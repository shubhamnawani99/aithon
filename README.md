# Challenge - Analyse the mental health of India during COVID using Twitter
## Description
This Covid-19 pandemic has severely affected countries around the world. The intensity of the pandemic is increasing very fast in India. The number of new cases is increasing every day, every week. In a span of six months, the total number of cases crossed 50 lakh and total number of deaths is almost I lakh. It has been observed that the sudden outbreaks of such pandemics affect public mental states and emotions. This pandemic also result in either constructive or destructive behavioural changes among people. Anger, Sadness, fear are the most common emotions witnessed among the people during several pandemics. Social media platform like Twitter and others have rich sources of information from people. 

### Introduction
Trained recurrent neural network (RNN) models for predicting emotions from English tweets. Our models work on characters hence we pass the whole tweet without any preprocessing as an input to the RNN. We are predicting the following emotion classification:
* Ekman's six basic emotions

### Files and Folders:
* __*level3.ipynb*__: script is showing how to use our models for predicting emotions in Jupiter Notebook.
* __*emotion_prediction.py*__: helper scripts that defines EmotionPredictor class.
* __*models/*__: contains trained RNN models.

### Example Usage

#### In Jupyter Notebook
Execute it locally using Jupyter Notebook by opening the `Level3.ipynb` file.
